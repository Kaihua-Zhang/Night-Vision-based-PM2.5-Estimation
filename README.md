# Vision-based-PM2.5-Estimation-in-Nighttime
Code and Data for paper 《Night Vision based PM2.5 Estimation》

## Data
The data used in the paper can be obtained through the following paths.  
   Note that the folder prefixed with 'ADD' stores the additional data obtained after increasing the sampling frequency.  
- Baidu Cloud Disk

   Extraction code: d6ef  
- Alibaba Cloud Disk

   Extraction code: 20ft  
   You may need unzip software available from https://7-zip.org/
   
The path and file name show the corresponding air quality, camera position, data, and time.  
For example, "\img_2023_0215_0217_1080p\c1\02151900\raw_30.13.png" means the 1080 × 1920 image is captured at location 1, February 15, 2023, 19:00, when PM2.5 sensor reading is 30.13 ug/m^3.

We also provide all other environment parameters in "Environment.csv".

We also release the 1440 × 2560 images that had not yet been codified.
